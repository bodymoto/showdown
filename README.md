Introducing Showdown, a Python SSH CLI created to capture system snapshots before and after downtime periods.<br/>
Created during my tenure at Amazon (rest assured, no proprietary information exists in this repository)<br/>
Showdown logs into each network switch, runs predefined commands, and saves the output to text files on the Desktop.<br/>
It became a convenient and practical solution for streamlining network operations.<br/>
This project holds a special place as my first original program.<br/>
