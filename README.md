Showdown is a Python program.<br/>
<br/>
Created to capture system snapshots before & after network upgrades during windows of company downtime.<br/>
Used during my tenure at Amazon while working as an IT Engineer.<br/>
Showdown SSH's into each instructed network switch (models Cisco X9300 & X9500), executes a set of predefined commands, & saves the output to a text file on your Desktop.<br/>
It was a convenient solution for automating basic project tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Saved to PIP for user convenience.<br/>

*Install:*
```pip install showdown.ssh```<br/>
*Location:*
```pip show showdown.ssh```
